# Self-avoiding_walk
 Group project Vincent en Wim
 Python & R course
 2024

This project is done for the Python & R course in June 2024. It is based around the concept of self-avoiding walks.

This project contains the following components:
    user manual:
        here you can read how to use our code to answer the questions.
    src: This folder contains the final code to answer the questions. 
        lattice: This is the main piece in which you can test functions
    earlier iterations: 
        This folder contains the first tries we have done on writing a working code. This is not necassary to answer the questions but only visible to support our design process.
