There are 2 special subclasses
    The subclass Fournbr will give a visual representation of a self-avoiding walk in a lattice with 4 neighbors
        To give an object this class use FourNbr()
    The subclass Threenbr will give a visual representation of a self-avoiding walk in a lattice with 3 neighbors
        To give an object this class use ThreeNbr()

There are 3 functions defined
    Calculate()
        This function is defined only on the FourNbr subclass
        This calculates the total amount of self-voiding walks for a given lenght
        Make sure your object has a lSAW
    Draw()
        This function is defined on ThreeNbr and FourNbr
        This gives a visual representation of a self-avoiding walk
    Distance()
        This function is defined on
        This will give the average distance from the starting point to the end of a SAW for a given lSAW.
