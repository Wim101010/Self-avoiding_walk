The code uses different types and function

We define a class for the lattice. This builts a lattice given the lenght of the SAW and the amount of neighbors.
The lattice's main information is stored in the cells. This is an array in which every value has a Boolean that represents if the path has already gone through this point. 

On this lattice we define different functions
    draw gives a visual representation of the SAW
    calculate gives the total amount of SAW's possible
