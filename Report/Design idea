# design choices
The code uses different types and function

## class organisation
We define a abstract class for the lattice. This builts a lattice given the lenght of the SAW and the amount of neighbors.
The lattice's main information is stored in the cells. This is an array in which every value has a Boolean that represents if the path has already gone through this point. 

On this lattice we define different functions (see more information on these functions later)
    draw gives a visual representation of the SAW
    calculate gives the total amount of SAW's possible
    distance gives the distance from the origin

## draw 
draw is the visual represenation
this is an abstract function that only has a implementation when neighbors = 4 or = 3
these self avoiding walks can be visualized in a two dimensional plane

## calculate
for this we use the cells stored in the abstract class
